# Overview of Project

As part of an assignment for the UT Data Boot Camp, an initial stock analysis was conducted for Steve. The original code was then refactored to loop only once. The purpose is to determine if the refactored changes made an impact on the run time.

Using run buttons, Steve will have the ability to put in the year into an input box, which removes any magic numbers. The VBA code uses a timer, arrays, if-then conditional statements, assigns long/string data types, and adds static/conditional formatting.

# Results

### Comparing 2017 and 2018 Stock Analysis
Comparing the 2017 and the 2018 stocks, the difference in the total daily volume between the two years that resulted in less than a $100,000,000 in increased volume was not enough to generate a positive 2018 return percentage. The tickers ENPH and RUN had would have been considered good investments due to the positive returns in 2018, and both of the tickers had increases greater than $200,000,000 over the 2017 total daily volumes.

### Comparing the Original Run Times to the Refactored Run Times

Run times for the original code took around 0.7 to 0.9 seconds for year 2017 and 2018 respectively
